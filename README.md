# TypeScript Theory and Practice

A focused, example-driven cheatsheet that covers only the features **unique to TypeScript** or those that add **real value** beyond JavaScript.

## Purpose

This repository is **not** a full TypeScript tutorial.  
Instead, it collects **concise, practical code examples** of TypeScript-specific features.

## Contribution

This is a personal learning project. Feel free to fork it, build on top of it, or adapt to your learning path.
